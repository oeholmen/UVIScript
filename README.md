# Synths, sequencers, modulators and more for UVI Falcon

This repo contains lua scripts for UVI Falcon.
There are several categories represented by the different folders.

Common for a lot of the scripts are that they use chance and probaility.

There are a few scripts for creating generative music. Check out generators.

The sequencers are a lot of fun! I recommend checking them out.

The main synth is the Tweak Synth. See docs in folder. Note that this requires a program patch to work. Contact me if you are interested.
